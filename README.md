<h3> This is my JOVAC Capastone Project </h3>

<h6> Here for this project I have applied the Logistic Regression Model. </h6>

<p><U><b> Dataset </b></U> for this project is a bag of words with 5172 rows and 3001 columns . All the words are in lowercase . The last column that is the "Prediction" column is our Y column upon which our model is need to be trained. </p>

<h4> Steps I have done here:- </h4>
<ol> <li> Importing the necessary libraries. </li>
  <li> Loadig the dataset. </li>
  <li> Data preprocessing. </li>
  <li> Training and Testing. </li>
  <li> Applied Logistic Regression Model. </li>
  <li> Checking the accuracy and the performance of the model. </li>
</ol>
